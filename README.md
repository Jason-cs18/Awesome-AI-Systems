# AI-Systems
As discussed in [1, 2], there are three system-level concerns in real-world AI applications. They are deployment, cost and accessibility.

## Deployment Concerns
Deployment concerns include **robustness** to adversarial influences or other spurious factors; safety more broadly considered; **privacy** and security, especially as sensitive data is increasingly used; **interpretability**, as is increasingly both legally and operationally required; **fairness**, as ML algorithms begin to have major effects on our everyday lives; and many other similar concerns.
